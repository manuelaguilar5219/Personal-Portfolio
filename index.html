    <p>. I have not yet started on this project but, I would like to use what I learn in this class, to create a web page that explains all the different types of stats in the sport of Baseball. Baseball statistics can be very confusing at times, so I think it would be a cool project that I can do to simplify the stats of Baseball.</p>
